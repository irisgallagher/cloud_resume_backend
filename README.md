The backend implementation for this project focuses on securely managing visitor data using AWS services. A DynamoDB table stores the visitor count, while a Lambda function written in Python retrieves and updates this count. An API Gateway endpoint acts as the bridge between the frontend and backend, triggering the Lambda function whenever the website loads. Security is enforced using the principle of least privilege, ensuring each component has only the necessary permissions to operate. Logs are monitored in CloudWatch to debug and optimize performance, providing insights into errors and performance metrics. This setup ensures scalability, reliability, and security for managing backend processes.
